# TODO:

- [ ] Implement authentication with Google/GitHub OAuth (see AUTH_STRATEGY.md)
- [ ] I would like to be able to search saved recipes
- [ ] Make it possible to share recipes with a shortened URL

## Completed:
- [x] Add a progress bar at the top of the page
- [x] Left swipe at the first page should take you back to the home page.
- [x] "Serves:" should only appear on the first page with the ingredients.
- [x] If there's a preheat oven, put that on the first page after the ingredients.
- [x] Make the steps text just a bit smaller.
- [x] On pages after the first page with ingredients, do not title it "Ingredients for this step:" Simply show it with the different shading.
- [x] If there are any notes in the recipe, show those on the second page, titled "Notes", and then proceed with the steps of the recipe.
- [x] Build a strategy around using Google and other login providers like Github (see AUTH_STRATEGY.md)
- [x] I would like to be able to save recipes
